# CelebDetect
The front end was built using Python Flask, JavaScript, HTML/CSS.  The back end utilizes the machine learning based Amazon Rekognition API, tuned to detect as many celebrities as possible in different settings, cosmetic makeup, and other conditions. The video file that is uploaded is stored using Amazon Web Services and LeanCloud.  Users search for the name of a celebrity or celebrities using the machine learning and neural net powered Google Speech-to-Text API.
